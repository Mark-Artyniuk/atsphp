A good open source script requires a great community of contributors.  Even if
one person can code an entire project by themselves (which I didn't), they
still typically do not have the artistic ability to design an attractive user
interface and they definitely are not fluent in 20 different languages.  So I
really do appreciate everyone who has helped me code, design, and translate
Aardvark Topsites PHP over the years.  I also appreciate the people who have
not directly worked with me, but have liberally licensed their work so
programmers like myself can create better products by standing on their
shoulders.

It goes without saying that I owe a deep debt of gratitute to the creators of
PHP, Apache, MySQL, Linux, and other prominent open source projects.  However,
in this file I would like to thank those who have directly aided in the
development of Aardvark Topsites PHP and those whose work is currently
distributed in this package.  If I forgot to put your name here, I apologize;
just email me or post at the forum and I will update it.

If you're a PHP coder and you would like to see your name here, then email me
(webmaster@aardvarkind.com) because I am always looking for new coders to bring
into the project.
