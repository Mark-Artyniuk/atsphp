ROADMAP
=======

5.1.0
  TODO
  Captcha refresh bug
  Improve search
  - $query="SELECT * FROM City WHERE LOCATE('$q', Name) > 0 ORDER BY LOCATE('$q', Name) LIMIT 7";
    - "I think LOCATE('$q',Name) can be set to an alias so you don't have to look it up twice"
  Delayed welcome email for approve-based lists
  - look into overall user experience for approval
  Web 2.0 to increase usability
  - RSS
  - AJAX
  aardvarkind to aardvarktopsitesphp
  2005 to 2006
  new settings:
    Make google-friendly links an option
    email admin when review is posted option
    - rethink admin emails: no skin needed?
    profanity filter
    - needs to filter members and reviews
  spruce up feed.php
  - description
  - new sites?
  mysqli plugin
  - offers little/no advantage
  define constant in index.php, etc. to prevent sources from being executed
  - including openid folder
  concurrent release of official mods:
  - category/page text links along with dropdown menu
  - change admin password
  openid
  - add links to explain openid
  - compare with zoomr
  - maybe create my own lightweight openid library?

  DONE
  More robust in non-standard environments (no <?=, handles weird files in languages dir)
  Custom pages from the admin
  When an edit form or join form has errors in it, the user is presented with inline error messages
  Admin does not allow you to delete the last category
  Major performance increase in rankings.php for lists with lots of sites per page
  Hits in from search engines are filtered to prevent cheating
  Order language list alphabetically
  Minor skin tweaks
  When a category name is edited, sites currently in that category are moved to the edited category
  Categories containing ampersands (&) work correctly
  RSS feed of the top 10 sites via feed.php
  Accounts can be created with an OpenID identity or with a traditional username and password
