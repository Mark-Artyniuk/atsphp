ROADMAP
=======

DONE SINCE 5.1.2
Various small admin UI fixes
Unapproved sites will not be automatically deleted for inactivity
Option in the admin to fill empty rows with "Your Site Here"
Backup database from admin
Validates $_SERVER before use
A (hopefully) more secure captcha, with a link for users to get a new captcha if they can't read the first
Displays the banner max width/height in the join and edit forms
Redesigned gateway page for the Fusion skin by OS-Mark
When you enable admin approval of new members, the welcome email is delayed until you approve the site
button.php only displays a button for valid, approved members
It is impossible to set the number of members per page to 0
Users cannot create their own categories by bypassing the join/edit forms
Quotes and other special HTML characters can be used in titles and descriptions without problems
Under normal usage, there should be no PHP error messages, even at E_ALL
Users pending approval will not be allowed to login to the user control panel
Banning of sites by URL, IP address, username, email

SQL:
ALTER TABLE `ats_ip_log` CHANGE `ip_address` `ip_address` VARCHAR( 245 ) NOT NULL;
CREATE TABLE `ats_ban` (
  `id` int(10) unsigned NOT NULL,
  `string` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `field` varchar(255) NOT NULL,
  `matching` tinyint(1) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY  (`id`)
);
ALTER TABLE `ats_settings` ADD `fill_blank_rows` TINYINT( 1 ) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL AFTER `ad_breaks`;
ALTER TABLE `ats_settings` ADD `smtp_server` VARCHAR( 255 ) DEFAULT '' NOT NULL AFTER `captcha`;
ALTER TABLE `ats_etc` ADD `version` VARCHAR( 255 ) NOT NULL;
UPDATE ats_etc SET version = '5.2.0';
ALTER TABLE `ats_sites` ADD `user_ip` VARCHAR( 255 ) DEFAULT '' NOT NULL AFTER `openid`;
----------- toptopsites.com has all above

-----
5.2.0
-----
ETA: Summer
HIGH PRIORITY:
better error handling if url wrappers are disabled
- detect when allow_url_fopen is disabled for max image sizes
- also for version check in the admin
security question (off by default, make user add a question manually)
- security section in the settings?
admin approve by default
change user_cp to user_cpl name to avoid 403 error
admin approve edits
- put sites in ats_sites_edited
- approve_edit.php based on approve.php
after install: form to aardvarktopsitesphp.com asking for email address for feedback
translate months in stats.php
- http://www.aardvarktopsitesphp.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=22262#22262
delete echo from send_email in skin.php; test welcome/approval emails
skins by os-mark
- nice-looking HTML emails?
credits.txt
- translators
cache overall stats (like in main page of admin) and allow all skins to post them
- unique only
- in, out, pageview
- average, today, yesterday, overall
GO BACK TO PLAIN TEXT EMAILS, BUT NICER
------------
LOW PRIORITY:
backlink checker
- This will check to see if your members have your topsites button up and are linking back to you.  However, this process may not be completely accurate, so do not take any drastic actions based only on the results presented here.
- some code: http://www.aardvarktopsitesphp.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=6242
"show all reviews" link should only be displayed if necessary
smtp email option via swift mailer (check email)
- if $CONF['smtp_server'] is set, use swift
valid code: http://www.aardvarktopsitesphp.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=4862
onmousedown instead of onclick for links: google does it
secondary ranking method to avoid ties
couple ratings and reviews so admin approves both
graphs
timestamp for jointime
no exits in base::error()
open proxies - http://www.aardvarktopsitesphp.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=4881
real averages... if site is new, average may be just 2 days
ad breaks with different banners: http://www.aardvarktopsitesphp.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=20999#20999
combine upgraders into one big file
dash instead of space in category_url
double quotes in search = phrase
search on manage members page

-----
5.3.0
-----
ETA: Who knows
HIGH PRIORITY:
openid
- old files in atsphp-openid folder
review admin ui
- instant refresh back to previous page after form submits
caching
- rankings.php
- button.php
  - store rank cache in a file to avoid connecting to database
------------
LOW PRIORITY:
custom form fields, auto-generated forms
tags instead of categories
