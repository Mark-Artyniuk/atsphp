ROADMAP
=======

5.1.0
  FOR BETA:
  - languages: english only
  - no upgrader
  - no mysqli
      mysqli plugin
      - offers little/no advantage

  FOR RC:
  - all languages
      aardvarkind to aardvarktopsitesphp, 2005 to 2006; define constant in index.php, etc. to prevent sources from being executed
      - todo: languages besides english, openid
  - upgrader

  FOR FINAL
  atsphp-mods
      - category/page text links along with dropdown menu
      - arbitrary hits in url - http://www.aardvarktopsitesphp.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=4484

FEATURES
- When an edit form or join form has errors in it, the user is presented with inline error messages
- RSS feed of the top 10 sites (overall and by category) via feed.php
- New admin stuff:
  - Topical links to the manual for confusing options on the settings page
  - Google-friendly links is now an option
  - Option to email admin when a new review is posted
  - Custom pages: easily add static content to integrate with your topsites (FAQ, rules, etc.)
  - Profanity filter
  - Overall stats displayed on main page

BUG FIXES
- More robust in non-standard environments (no <?=, handles weird files in languages dir)
- Major performance increase in rankings.php for lists with lots of sites per page
- Hits in from search engines are filtered to prevent cheating
- Language list is ordered alphabetically
- Minor skin tweaks
- When a category name is edited, sites currently in that category are moved to the edited category
- Categories containing ampersands (&) work correctly
- Admin does not allow you to delete the last category
- Minor search improvements (UI and sorting)
- When users join lists that require admin approval, they are warned that they will not be listed immediately
- Uses preg_replace_callback() instead of preg_replace() to speed up skin parsing
  - 10% faster skin parsing results in 1% faster overall script execution
