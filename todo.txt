ROADMAP
=======

DONE SINCE 5.1.2
Various small admin UI fixes
Unapproved sites will not be automatically deleted for inactivity
Option in the admin to fill empty rows with "Your Site Here"
Backup database from admin
Validates $_SERVER before use
A more secure captcha, with a link for users to get a new captcha if the user can't read the first one
Displays the banner max width/height in the join and edit forms
Redesigned gateway page for the Fusion skin by OS-Mark
When you enable admin approval of new members, the welcome email is delayed until you approve the site
button.php only displays a button for valid, approved members
It is impossible to set the number of members per page to 0
Users cannot create their own categories by bypassing the join/edit forms
Quotes and other special HTML characters can be used in titles and descriptions without problems
Under normal usage, there should be no PHP error messages, even at E_ALL
Users pending approval will not be allowed to login to the user control panel
Banning of sites by URL, IP address, username, email
Checks if allow_url_fopen is On before checking banner size and checking for the latest version
Missing </option> tags were added so that all pages should validate as XHTML 1.0 Transitional
user_cp.php renamed to user_cpl.php because of mod_security on some servers
Optional security question on join to block spammers
By default, new members must be approved by the admin before they are listed
By default, changes to the title or URL of a site must be approved by the admin
New skin file table_wrapper.html to easily display things only on ranking pages
Overall stats displayed on the main page
Password confirmation on the join page to prevent typos

------------
LOW PRIORITY:
up/down arrows
backlink checker
- This will check to see if your members have your topsites button up and are linking back to you.  However, this process may not be completely accurate, so do not take any drastic actions based only on the results presented here.
- some code: http://www.aardvarktopsitesphp.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=6242
"show all reviews" link should only be displayed if necessary
smtp email option via swift mailer (check email)
onmousedown instead of onclick for links: google does it

couple ratings and reviews so admin approves both
graphs
timestamp for jointime
no exits in base::error()
open proxies - http://www.aardvarktopsitesphp.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=4881

combine upgraders into one big file
dash instead of space in category_url
double quotes in search = phrase
search on manage members page
cache list of valid usernames in a plain text file to avoid connecting to db to check for valid members
