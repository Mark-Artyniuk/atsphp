ROADMAP
=======

-----
5.2.0
-----
get rid of old mailing list

-----
5.3.0
-----
HIGH PRIORITY:
openid
- old files in atsphp-openid folder
review admin ui
- instant refresh back to previous page after form submits
caching
- rankings.php, cache main page?  is it worth it?
- hypothesis: most people only look at the first page.  back it up with w3counter stats for toptopsites.com
cron.php: run it via ajax instead of all in one process
captcha in rate.php
------------
LOW PRIORITY:
auto update members with default banner on admin change
custom form fields, auto-generated forms
tags instead of categories
improve up/down arrows
backlink checker
- This will check to see if your members have your topsites button up and are linking back to you.  However, this process may not be completely accurate, so do not take any drastic actions based only on the results presented here.
- some code: http://www.aardvarktopsitesphp.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=6242
"show all reviews" link should only be displayed if necessary
smtp email option via swift mailer (check email)
onmousedown instead of onclick for links: google does it
secondary ranking method to avoid ties
couple ratings and reviews so admin approves both
graphs
timestamp for jointime
no exits in base::error()
open proxies - http://www.aardvarktopsitesphp.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=4881
real averages... if site is new, average may be just 2 days
ad breaks with different banners: http://www.aardvarktopsitesphp.com/forums/viewtopic.php?p=20999#20999
combine upgraders into one big file
dash instead of space in category_url
double quotes in search = phrase
search on manage members page
cache list of valid usernames in a plain text file to avoid connecting to db to check for valid members
